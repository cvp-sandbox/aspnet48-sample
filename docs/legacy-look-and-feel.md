# Remaining Steps for Maintaining Legacy Look and Feel
Here's a list of the remaining steps to complete the migration of the look and feel from the .NET Framework 4.8 application to the .NET 9.0 application:

1. Create a Modernizr Compatibility Script
Create a modernizr.js file in the wwwroot/js directory that provides the core functionality from the legacy modernizr-2.8.3.js
Add this script to the _Layout.cshtml file in the head section
2. Copy Bootstrap Theme and Customizations
Ensure the Bootstrap theme from the legacy application is applied to the new application
Copy any custom Bootstrap overrides from the legacy application
3. Update Form Styling
Ensure form elements have consistent styling between the applications
Apply legacy form validation styling to the new application's forms
4. Copy Additional CSS from Legacy Application
Check for any additional CSS files or inline styles in the legacy application
Port these styles to the new application
5. Update Individual View Templates
As you migrate each view, ensure the HTML structure matches the legacy application
Pay special attention to class names and element hierarchies
6. Create View Component Equivalents
For any partial views or reusable components in the legacy application, create equivalent View Components in the new application
7. Test Cross-Browser Compatibility
Test the application in the same browsers supported by the legacy application
Ensure consistent rendering across browsers
8. Create a Style Guide Document
Document the styling patterns and conventions for future development
Include examples of common UI elements and their implementation
9. Implement Progressive Enhancement
Ensure the application works without JavaScript
Add JavaScript enhancements in a way that matches the legacy application's behavior
10. Accessibility Verification
Verify that accessibility features from the legacy application are maintained
Ensure ARIA attributes and roles are properly implemented
By following these steps, you'll ensure that the new .NET 9.0 application maintains the same look and feel as the legacy .NET Framework 4.8 application, providing a seamless experience for users as you incrementally migrate functionality.
