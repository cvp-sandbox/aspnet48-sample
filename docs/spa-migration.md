# React SPA Migration Plan

## Objective

The goal is to modernize the `EventRegistrationSystem` application, written in:
* .NET Framework 4.8 and uses 
* ASP.NET MVC (cshtml views, layout, and partials)
* Bootstrap
* Jquery

The new application, `event-management-spa`, a React+Vite application will be the new front-end. It will use the `EventManagement.Api` as the `backend for frontend` for any "backend needs"

## Notes
1. Keep the migration plan up to date in `docs\spa-migration.md`
2. Track migration progress in `docs\spa-migration-tasks.md`
